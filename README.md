# TCA-VR

A very experimental mod to run Tiny Combat Arena in VR.

This is still very experimental so I'm not making any builds at this time, it is still unplayable to the point it might get you to puke if you try to play it for real. But if you're still interested in building it yourself for development purposes and need any help feel free to open an issue.
